# Flask API Project

Build a web application similar to that used in my [learning_flask](https://github.com/isabelleberger/learning_flask) repository, but using a different API. This is based on the [PacktPublishing learning-flask](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/learning-flask) course. 

I chose to use the API for [OpenData DC Metro Bus Stops](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/metro-bus-stops/geoservice?geometry=-77.007%2C38.896%2C-76.977%2C38.902), which maps all of the bus stops in the city.
